			Installation Procedure

0) Preparation

To build and install the uGet Integration, you need to unpack the
archive (which you have presumably done, since you are reading this),
and read on. uGet Integration uses the GNU Autoconf mechanism for
build and installation.

1) Configuration

To configure, run the configure script provided with the
distribution.  You may use all the standard arguments configure
scripts take.  The most important ones are:

  --help                  print help message

  --prefix=PREFIX         install architecture-independent files in PREFIX
                          (/usr/local by default)
  --bindir=DIR            user executables in DIR (PREFIX/bin)

  --build=BUILD           configure for building on BUILD [BUILD=HOST]
  --host=HOST             configure for HOST [guessed]
  --target=TARGET         configure for TARGET [TARGET=HOST]

So, if you want to configure uGet Integration for installation in your home
directory, you can type:
./configure --prefix=$HOME

To configure uGet Integration on Windows, use Cygwin to configure and compile.

2) Compilation

After the compilation, the `uget-integration-host` executable should reside
in the src directory. You can test it by running it with '--version'.

3) Installation

Use `make install' to install uGet Integration to directories specified to
configure (/usr/local/* by default).

The standard installation process will copy the wget binary to
/usr/local/bin, and the host JSON file to the appropriated OS path.
The JSON file path should not be changed since any change can affect
how the browser find the executable.

To delete the files created by the installation, you can use make
uninstall.

To install uGet Integration on Windows, the easiest way is to generate the
installer using Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS) script located
at 'builds/Win/uget-integration-host.nsi'.
